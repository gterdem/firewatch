"""API-only response shapes for the FireWatch read and write surfaces.

These types are HTTP-delivery concerns and do NOT belong in firewatch-sdk.
Plugins and core never produce them — the SDK stays delivery-agnostic (ADR-0029 D5).

The pagination envelope mirrors the store's ``get_paginated`` return exactly
(ADR-0029 D2 — expose verbatim, no re-wrapping or key renaming).

Ingest shapes (ADR-0029 D7 — MC.3):
  ``IngestRequest`` / ``BatchIngestRequest`` are the POST /logs request bodies.
  ``IngestResponse`` is the response envelope (inserted + deduped counts, mirroring
  the store's ``save_many`` return contract per ADR-0007/0016).

  The ``data`` field in ``IngestRequest`` is attacker-controlled (ADR-0015 / ADR-0029 D3).
  It is treated as opaque and flows into the plugin's ``normalize()`` and the event's
  ``raw_log`` — never interpolated into log messages as a format string.
