/**
 * triageBand — shared triage-actor derivation logic (issue #650, ADR-0059 D1+D2;
 * issue #42, ADR-0067 D2/D7 — the null-tier guard).
 *
 * Extracted from DashboardRoute.tsx so it can be imported by tests and other
 * consumers without violating the react-refresh/only-export-components lint rule
 * (which requires route files to export only React components as the default).
 *
 * ``deriveTriageActors`` is the canonical implementation of:
 *   is_alert_worthy(threat, triageThreshold) :=
 *     bandMeets(threat.threat_level, triageThreshold)   // band axis — ADR-0036
 *     OR isHighTierEscalation(threat)                  // action-aware axis — ADR-0058
 *
 * The two axes are OR-combined and NEVER collapsed into a single number (ADR-0036).
 *
 * ``deriveObservedRecord`` (issue #43, ADR-0067 D5(2)) is the aggregate-line
 * derivation for the observed stratum: every actor carrying disposition
 * "observed" that did NOT independently earn a banner slot (via the band
 * axis) rolls up into one honest count — never silently dropped. Built from
 * engine integers only (a sum of ``total_events``, a count of distinct
 * ``source_types`` values) — no attacker-controlled text ever reaches the
 * banner (ADR-0035 discipline).
 *
 * SECURITY / correctness (ADR-0067 D2, issue #42): ``EscalationVerdict.tier`` is
 * ``number | null`` — the ADR-0067 observed stratum emits ``tier: null`` for actors
 * with no qualifying escalation signal. In JavaScript, ``null <= 2`` evaluates to
 * ``true`` (null coerces to 0 in a relational comparison) — an unguarded
 * ``t.escalation.tier <= 2`` would silently re-admit EVERY observed actor into the
 * triage banner, reproducing the exact flood ADR-0067 fixes, with no error and no
 * failing type check (TypeScript does not flag `null <= 2`). ``isHighTierEscalation``
 * below explicitly null-guards before the comparison.

 *
 * ADR-0058 §4a: Tier 1 (allowed-through) and Tier 2 (block-status-unknown)
 * are banner-worthy even when the numeric score is LOW or MEDIUM — the
 * action axis is a *second axis* presented alongside the band (ADR-0036).
 *
 * ADR-0067 D2/D7: ``tier`` may be ``null`` (the observed stratum — no
 * escalation claim). Explicitly null-guarded: ``null <= 2`` is ``true`` in
 * JavaScript, so omitting this check would silently treat every observed
 * actor as Tier 1/2 and reproduce the pre-#42 flood in the UI only.

 * Derive the list of actors that still need a triage decision.

 * AND not yet dismissed.
 *
 * The band half is parameterised by the operator-configurable Triage threshold
 * (ADR-0059 D1 / issue #650). Default "HIGH" preserves today's {CRITICAL, HIGH} set exactly.
 * The escalation-tier half is UNCONDITIONAL — ADR-0058 D2 / ADR-0036 (two axes never collapsed).
 *
 * Sort order: tier-1 escalations first, then tier-2, then by score descending
 * (so the loudest signals lead — ADR-0058 "Tier 1 = loudest").
 * Actors without an escalation verdict sort as tier 99 (after tiered ones).
 *
 * ADR-0072 D3: queue membership is `escalated && !(triage_decision?.suppressed)`.
 * `isSuppressed` reads the server-computed annotation only — no client-side
 * lifecycle logic (the pre-#47 localStorage `isDismissed` is retired).
